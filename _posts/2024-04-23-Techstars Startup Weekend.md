## Overview

I recently attended [Techstars Startup Weekend](https://www.techstars.com/communities/startup-weekend). It was a 54-hour event where developers, designers, marketers, product managers, and startup enthusiasts come together to share ideas, form teams, build products, and launch startups. The event was hosted in Irvine, California as part of the city's Tech Week. I was part of a team that built a web application called OpenDoor. My founder pitched it as "The Duolingo of Personal Finance". It turns out 54 hours isn't a whole lot of time to convert an idea into a working MVP using my preferred technology, React Native, so I proposed Flutterflow for the weekend's development. Here's what I learned from the experience:

## Flutterflow for building out minimum viable products

Flutterflow is a no-code tool that allows you to build out Flutter applications. It's a great way to quickly prototype ideas and build out minimum viable products, particularly for mobile applications. It was a great way to quickly iterate on the design and get feedback from potential users.

## Collaboration is difficult

There was a problem with the tool though: Collaboration was difficult. It was hard to work on the same project with multiple people, in my case, one other developer.

## The importance of a good pitch

The pitch is everything. It's the first thing that people hear about your idea, and it's what they'll remember. It's important to have a clear, concise pitch that gets people excited about your idea.

## The MVP can be purely visual

The MVP doesn't have to be a working product. It can be a visual representation of what the product will look like. This can be a great way to get feedback from potential users and investors without having to spend a lot of time building out the product. Framer is a great tool for rapidly building out product UIs.

## Deeply consider the business model

There were a number of hard questions from the judges about the business model. It's important to deeply consider the business model and be able to answer questions about how the product will make money.

## Techstars Startup Weekend is not about developing a product

It was about 24-hours into the weekend, when mentors came around to provide feedback to the teams. It was during these mentoring sessions that I realized: the event is not about developing a product, it's about developing a business. The product is just a means to an end. When I attend the next event, my expertise as a developer will be more useful in helping the team develop a business model and pitch with a sound technical foundation.

## So what about this technical foundation?

If I were to build this application out for real, I would use React Native. Flutterflow is great for quickly prototyping ideas, but it's not a great tool for building out a real product. React Native is a great tool for building out cross-platform mobile applications, and it's what I'm most comfortable with. I would also use ConvexDB for the backend, as it's a great way to quickly build out a backend for your application. Clerk is a great way to quickly add authentication to your application. The combination of these tools would allow me to quickly build out a real product.

## Techstars is about making connections

The event was a great way to make connections with other developers, designers, marketers, and startup enthusiasts. It was a great way to meet people who are passionate about building products and launching startups. I made some great connections at the event, and I'm looking forward to attending the next one.
