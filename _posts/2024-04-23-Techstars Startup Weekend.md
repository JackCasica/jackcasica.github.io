This past weekend, I immersed myself in the whirlwind of innovation at the Techstars Startup Weekend in Irvine, California. Unlike typical hackathons, this 54-hour event wasn't just about coding; it was a deep dive into the startup culture, complete with pitching, team forming, and product launching. Here's a breakdown of my experience and some advice for developers considering such an event.

### Finding the Right Idea

The event kicked off with participants pitching a wide array of ideas—from a D&D platform for kids to a local grocery price tracker. Interestingly, the grocery tracker idea, pitched by a developer next to me who had not initially intended to lead, ended up placing third. This spontaneity in pitching and the unexpected success that followed were my first takeaways: be open to unexpected leadership and innovation opportunities.

### Choosing a Team and a Project

I joined a team working on "OpenDoor," dubbed the DuoLingo for personal finance. The project aimed to simplify personal finance through hyper-personalized content and gamification. My decision to join was based on the feasibility of crafting a functional MVP over the weekend—a critical criterion for a fruitful Techstars experience.

### Selecting the Tech Stack: Why FlutterFlow?

Our choice of FlutterFlow for development was strategic, aimed at quickly prototyping the application. Despite the allure of no-code/low-code platforms like FlutterFlow, the weekend highlighted a significant limitation: collaboration challenges. Although these tools are excellent for rapid prototyping, they can hinder simultaneous multi-developer involvement, affecting productivity under tight deadlines.

### The Realization: It's Not About the Code

Mid-event mentor feedback shifted our focus from hardcore development to refining our pitch. This pivot underscored a crucial lesson: Techstars Startup Weekend is more about crafting a compelling business case than perfect coding. The MVP, we realized, could simply be a visual prototype—adequately served by tools like Framer, which I found superior to Figma for this purpose due to its robust animation tools and ease of sharing.

### Rethinking the Developer's Role

At such events, a developer's role transcends coding; it's about laying a sound technical foundation and ensuring the feasibility of the project. As the weekend progressed, it became clear that our real product was not the app itself but the business pitch and the conceptual framework around it.

### Recommendations for Future Participants

-Be Prepared for a Non-Coding Experience: The event might not require writing any code. Focus on demonstrating -the technical feasibility and preparing a solid pitch.
-Evaluate the Business Model: Understand the startup’s business model deeply as you will face critical questions from judges and potential investors.
-Opt for Visual Prototypes: Use tools like Framer to build interactive, visually appealing prototypes to showcase your idea effectively.

### Conclusion: Valuable Connections Over Winning

Despite not winning or writing code, the event was immensely successful in terms of networking and learning. I formed meaningful connections with passionate individuals, which are as valuable as any prize.

I encourage any developer interested in the startup world to participate in Techstars Startup Weekend. It's a unique platform to test your skills in real-world scenarios and understand the startup ecosystem intimately. Ready to connect and discuss more?

This past weekend I attended [Techstars Startup Weekend](https://www.techstars.com/communities/startup-weekend), a 54-hour event where developers, designers, marketers, product managers, and startup enthusiasts come together to share ideas, form teams, build products, and launch startups. It is a global event with over 193 host countries. The event was hosted in Irvine, California, a notable tech hub in Southern California.

Spoiler alert: I didn't write a single line of code nor did my team win. But I did learn alot about startups at their earliest phases. Here's my write up of the weekend. Hopefully it's helpful to any developer considering attending a Techstars Startup Weekend in their city.

## Finding an idea

The first hours of the event consisted of pitching ideas and forming teams. There were a number of ideas pitched from D&D for kids, to a local grocery price tracker. The founder for the latter was actually a dev who I sat next to during introductions. He didn't come with the intent to be a founder for the weekend, but he joined the pitching queue on a whim. During team selections, he whispered to me that he hoped his idea woudn't get picked. Despite this, his idea was well recieved, a team was formed around it, and it ended up placing third in the competition.

I ended up joining a team that was working on a mobile application called OpenDoor. The pitch was "the DuoLingo of personal finance". The product was a mobile application that would help people learn about personal finance through hyperpersonalized content and gamification. The founder, Ruby Mejia had recently won a 5k grant to continue working on the project. My personal criteria for choosing a team for the weekend was based on the feasability of building a working minimum viable product over the course of a weekend. Unlike other ideas pitched the evening, which seemed to involed gatheit seemed possible to build a solid MVP around OpenDoor with the time provided.

## Choosing a tech stack

Coming into the weekend, I was prepared to work with any technology stack that the team decided on. Having built ZippyAds Driver, a mobile application for tracking mobile advertsizing campaigns, in FlutterFlow and then in React Native, I felt prepared to work with either technology. What we ultimately decided on was FlutterFlow, a no-code/low-code tool that allows you to build out applications quickly. I demoed one of Flutterflow's starter templates to the team and we agreed to use FlutterFlow for the weekend's development.

### Why FlutterFlow?

FlutterFlow is a great tool for building out MVPs quickly. It allows you to build out applications visually, without having to write any code. It's a great way to quickly prototype ideas and get feedback from potential users. It's also a great way to build out applications without having to worry about the technical details. I've used FlutterFlow in the past to build out MVPs quickly, and I've found it to be a great tool for building out applications quickly.

Despite my believe that Flutterflow is a fantastic tool for building out MVPs and my preference for React Native and Expo for it's comfortable developer experience, in hindsight, I don't beliee either is the tool for Techstars Allstar Weekend. Keep reading to find out why.

It turns out 54 hours isn't a whole lot of time to convert an idea into a working MVP. React Native, so I proposed Flutterflow for the weekend's development. Here's what I learned from the experience:

## Collaboration is difficult

There was a problem with the tool though: Collaboration was difficult. It was hard to work on the same project with multiple people, in my case, one other developer.

## The importance of a good pitch

The pitch is everything. It's the first thing that people hear about your idea, and it's what they'll remember. It's important to have a clear, concise pitch that gets people excited about your idea.

## Techstars Startup Weekend is not about developing a product

About halfway into the 54-hour weekend event, a group of mentors came around to each team to with feedback. One consistend piece of advice was to focus on the pitch rather than developing the product.

It was during these mentoring sessions that I realized the event is not about developing an MVP, it's about developing a business pitch.

## The MVP can be purely visual

The MVP doesn't have to be a working product. It can be a visual representation of what the product will look like. This can be a great way to get feedback from potential users and investors without having to spend a lot of time building out the product. Framer is a great tool for rapidly building out product UIs.

## What is a developers role at Techstars Startup Weekend?

Given that an MVP can be a visual representation of a product concept, I would argue that a developers role during Techstars is to provide the founders with a sound technical foundation for the startup and to be prepeared to answer question about the technical implementation.

The most important roles are the founder and the designer. The founder is responsible for coming up with the idea and the designer is responsible for creating the pitch deck. The developer is responsible for building the product, but the product doesn't have to be a working product. It can be a visual representation of what the product will look like.

## Recommendation

Here are a few recommendations for any developer considering attending a Techstars Startup Weekend:

### Be prepared to not write any code

The MVP doesn't have to be a working product. It can be a visual representation of what the product will look like. Be prepared to not write any code and focus on proofing the technical feasibility of the product.

### Deeply consider the business model

There were a number of hard questions from the judges about the business model. On presentation day, the first team to present to a panel of judges consisted of a sole developer. He was asked question about the technical costs to develop the product. It's important to deeply consider the business model and be able to answer questions about how the product will make money.

## The Best Path Forward: Framer

With this understanding, it was clear to me that the MVP could be purely visual and that my fellow developer and I's efforts would be better spent of consulting with our founder to develop a business pitch with a sound technical foundation. I would recommend using Framer for this purpose. Framer is a great tool for rapidly building out product UIs, and it's a great way to get feedback from potential users and investors.

### Why not Figma?

As someone who has worked in Figma before, I can recommend Framer over Figma for this purpose. Framer's UX is quick to pick up coming form Figma with a few added benefits:

- Framer supports publishing to the web, which is great for sharing the MVP with potential users and investors.
- Framers animation tools are more robust than Figma's, which is great for creating interactive prototypes.
- Framer's approach for building out components in multiple viewports makes building responsive UIs less of an afterthought.

## So what about this technical foundation?

If I were to build this application out for real, I would use React Native. Flutterflow is great for quickly prototyping ideas, but it's not a great tool for building out a real product. React Native is a great tool for building out cross-platform mobile applications, and it's what I'm most comfortable with. I would also use ConvexDB for the backend, as it's a great way to quickly build out a backend for your application. Clerk is a great way to quickly add authentication to your application. The combination of these tools would allow me to quickly build out a real product.

## Meaningful connections should be the goal

As I mentioned, my team didn't place and we didn't write a single line of code, but my criteria for a successful weekend was to find like-minded people excited about developing good product.

You don't have to actively work on making connections either. Simply by participating in the event and working through long hours with a team, you'll naturally make connections with others. It's a great way to meet people who are passionate about building products and launching startups.

The event was a fantasitc way to make connections with other developers, designers, marketers, and startup enthusiasts. It was a great way to meet people who are passionate about building products and launching startups. I made some great connections at the event, and I'm looking forward to attending the next one.

Our team consisted of two devs and two designers and we all agreed at the end to have had a very positive working relationship with each other. Ruby, our products founder, has approached me to continue working on the project -->
