### Insights from Techstars Startup Weekend: Building OpenDoors

Attending the Techstars Startup Weekend in Irvine, California, was an incredible experience that I undertook with the goals of networking, learning about startup culture, and adding a real product to my portfolio. This 54-hour hackathon was not just focused on development but on building and pitching a startup MVP. Here’s a detailed account of my journey and the lessons I learned along the way.

#### Team Formation and Project Selection

Choosing the right project was crucial. I opted to work on OpenDoors, a mobile application pitched as the Duolingo of personal finance. This project stood out to me because of its viability in terms of building a high-quality MVP over the weekend. OpenDoors aimed to help users develop financial literacy through an engaging, interactive experience.

**Project Pitch:**
OpenDoors was initially pitched by a Hispanic founder who had previously won a grant for the concept, which highlighted its potential and validation. The app was designed to make financial education accessible and engaging, similar to how Duolingo makes language learning fun. The founder's passion for improving financial literacy, especially within underserved communities, resonated with me, making the project even more appealing.

**Team Composition:**
Our team comprised two designers, two developers, and two founders. The diverse skill set was promising, and we quickly aligned on our roles. This composition allowed for a well-rounded approach, where each member could leverage their strengths to contribute to the project’s success. The founders provided vision and direction, the designers focused on user experience and interface, and the developers handled the technical implementation.

#### Challenges and Solutions

We faced several challenges during the development process, primarily around collaboration on FlutterFlow, which required a paid plan for full access. Additionally, there were delays in translating the Figma designs into the MVP, resulting in idle time for me and the other developer.

**Collaboration Issues:**
FlutterFlow’s paywall was a significant hurdle. As a no-code platform, it was attractive for its speed and ease of use, but the restriction on collaboration without a paid plan limited our ability to work simultaneously on different parts of the project. Our workaround involved working on separate screens individually and then pasting them into the main project. This was not ideal, as it caused frequent interruptions when FlutterFlow’s limitations kicked us out of the main project after prolonged use.

**Design Translation Delays:**
Another challenge was the time lag between design creation and implementation. The designers were working diligently on Figma, but the development team often found themselves waiting for the designs to be completed. This idle time was not productive and highlighted the need for better synchronization between design and development.

**Solutions Implemented:**
To address these issues, we utilized FlutterFlow’s built-in templates to speed up the process. This allowed us to use pre-made components and adapt them to fit our needs quickly. While this was not a perfect solution, it enabled us to move forward without waiting for custom designs. Additionally, we improved our communication with the design team to ensure a more seamless handoff and quicker iterations.

#### Mentorship and Feedback

Throughout the weekend, we received valuable feedback from mentors, including a designer who advised us to focus more on the pitch than on the detailed MVP. This shift in focus was crucial. We began prioritizing the theoretical aspects of our implementation, which allowed us to guide our founders on the technical feasibility and future development paths rather than getting bogged down in coding details.

**Mentorship Sessions:**
We interacted with several experienced mentors, including designers, product developers, and startup founders. Their collective advice was instrumental in shaping our approach. One mentor emphasized the importance of storytelling in the pitch, suggesting that a compelling narrative about how OpenDoors could impact users’ lives was more critical than showcasing a fully functional app.

**Impact of Feedback:**
This feedback prompted us to pivot our strategy. Instead of spending all our time on the technical aspects, we focused on how to present the value proposition of OpenDoors effectively. We assisted the founders in crafting a story that highlighted the app’s potential to improve financial literacy, especially in underserved communities. This shift allowed us to make better use of our time and resources, aligning our efforts with the event’s ultimate goal of pitching a viable startup.

#### Technical Decisions and Lessons Learned

One significant technical decision was to use Plaid for secure banking integration within our app. Plaid handles the compliance aspects of dealing with sensitive user information, ensuring that user data is secure without being stored on our servers.

**Plaid Integration:**
Plaid was chosen for its robust security features and ease of integration. It allows applications to connect with users’ bank accounts securely, handling the complex compliance requirements that come with managing financial data. This decision was crucial for OpenDoors, given its focus on personal finance.

**Platform Decision:**
While FlutterFlow was chosen for its cross-platform capabilities, we realized that using Framer could have been more efficient. Framer’s intuitive UI and one-click publish feature would have allowed all team members, including designers, to collaborate seamlessly, blending roles and accelerating our development process. Framer’s ability to quickly prototype interactive UIs without deep technical knowledge would have enabled us to iterate faster and present a polished, albeit non-functional, prototype.

**Hindsight Reflections:**
In hindsight, focusing on a tool that facilitated rapid prototyping and seamless collaboration would have been more strategic. Framer, with its flexibility and ease of use, would have allowed us to present a visually appealing and interactive prototype, which is often sufficient for initial pitches. This approach would have minimized idle time and improved overall productivity.

#### Final Outcomes and Reflections

By the end of the weekend, we had a functioning MVP with a login flow, user onboarding, and a sample lesson. Although not fully complete, it demonstrated the core functionality of OpenDoors. Our founders delivered a compelling pitch, supported by the technical insights we provided.

**MVP State:**
The MVP included a basic login flow, an onboarding process to gather user details, and a sample lesson to showcase the educational content. This limited functionality was enough to demonstrate the app’s potential and provide a glimpse of its user experience.

**Pitch Presentation:**
The pitch was delivered by the founders, with the rest of the team present for support. They effectively communicated the app’s vision, its impact on financial literacy, and the plan for future development. The feedback from the judges was positive, emphasizing the importance of the problem we aimed to solve and the clarity of our presentation.

**Team Dynamics:**
Working closely with the team fostered strong relationships, which extended beyond the event. The collaborative effort, despite the challenges, was a valuable experience in teamwork and problem-solving. The founders expressed interest in continuing to work on OpenDoors, and we discussed the possibility of further developing the MVP over the summer.

**Hindsight Reflections:**
Reflecting on the event, I realized that aligning with projects that match my interests, such as those involving AI, would have been more fulfilling. Additionally, the importance of pitch preparation over technical details was a key lesson. Tools like Framer, which facilitate rapid prototyping, will be my go-to for future hackathons.

#### Advice for Future Participants

For anyone considering participating in a startup weekend, my advice is to:

- **Team and Project Selection:** Choose a team and project that align with your interests and strengths. This alignment will keep you motivated and engaged throughout the intense 54-hour period.
- **Focus on the Pitch:** The pitch is often more critical than the actual MVP. Craft a compelling narrative that clearly communicates the problem your solution addresses and its potential impact.
- **Use Rapid Prototyping Tools:** Utilize tools like Framer for quick UI development. These tools enable rapid iteration and seamless collaboration, saving valuable time and ensuring a polished final product.

#### Conclusion

Overall, the Techstars Startup Weekend was an invaluable experience. It provided a platform for rapid learning, collaboration, and networking. I developed close relationships with the team members and gained insights that will undoubtedly benefit my future projects. I am looking forward to participating again and am excited about the potential of continuing work on OpenDoors.

This event was not just about building an MVP but about understanding the dynamics of startup culture, making strategic decisions under pressure, and presenting a viable product. These experiences have enriched my professional journey as a developer, designer, and product builder, and I am eager to apply these lessons to future endeavors.
