## Local Meetups

My first experience attending a local meetup was at a Clever Programmer event in Los Angeles in 2021. Clever Programmer is a YouTube channel that teaches programming and software development. The event was a great opportunity to meet like-minded individuals who were also learning to code. I met a few people who were also self-taught developers and we shared our experiences and struggles. It was reassuring to know that I wasn't alone in my journey and that others were facing similar challenges.
