## Overview

The project is a web application that leverages a tech stack comprising React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS for front-end development. Configurations such as TypeScript type checking, custom Tailwind CSS enhancements, image optimization, and Autoprefixer styling are set up through files like tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.ts, next.config.mjs, and postcss.config.js. The package.json file manages dependencies and scripts, integrating Storybook for component development. Additionally, the pnpm-lock.yaml file in the app directory enables dynamic rendering of website sections like about, blog, and contact pages to ensure a seamless user experience. This project's core functionalities lie in providing a visually appealing and performant web application with optimized images, dynamic content rendering, and component-based development facilitated by Storybook.
